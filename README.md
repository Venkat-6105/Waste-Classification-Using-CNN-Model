## Waste Classification Visualization
Dataset:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data

This project provides a visualization of waste classification into two categories: Organic and Recyclable. Using Python and Matplotlib, the data is represented in a visually appealing pie chart with color-coded sections for easy interpretation.

## Features
 ## Categories:
  1. Organic (Green section)
  2. Recyclable (Sky Blue section)
 ## Pie Chart Customizations:
  * Labels with percentages.
  * Exploded slices for better visual distinction.
  * Intuitive color scheme for easy understanding.
## Example Output
  The chart shows the proportion of organic and recyclable waste in a dataset. Here's an example of the output:

## Dependencies
  * Python
  * Matplotlib
  * Pandas (if data preprocessing is involved)
  * Numpy 
  * Tensorflow
## Usage
  Load the dataset containing labels for waste classification.
  Run the provided Python script to generate the pie chart.
  Customize colors or chart properties as needed.
